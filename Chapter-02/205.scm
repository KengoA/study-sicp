; Exercise 2.5: Show that we can represent pairs of nonnegative integers using only
; numbers and arithmetic operations if we represent the pair a and b as the integer
; that is the product 2a 3b. Give the corresponding definitions of the procedures cons, car, and cdr.

(define (cons a b)
    (* (expt 2 a) (expt 3 b)))

(define )
